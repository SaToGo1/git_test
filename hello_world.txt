Good Morning World

UwU
What do you mean? Do you wish me a good morning or do you mean
that it is a good morning wheter i want it or nor? Or perhaps
you mean to say that you feel good on this particular morning?
Or are you simply stating that this is a morning to be good on? 
Hm?

All of them at once, I suppose.
